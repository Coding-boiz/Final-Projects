# Final-Projects
(if you don't know how github works, just go look it up, its to complicated for me to explain here.

Ok so the point of this repository is for finished projects. The project has to be able to run as intended before being put here, but you can still update it afterwards. If you want a repository to use while working on your own projects, just create a new one. There is a folder for each person in this group. keep all of your files in that folder, but in there, you can do whatever you want. There is also a hall of fame folder. The only way to get a project in there is either by having the entirety of the coding boiz allow it. If you have a project that you would like to have added to the hall of fame, tell me and I'll setup a poll.
